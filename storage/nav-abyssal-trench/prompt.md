# Abyssal Trench Navbar

A deep-sea bio-luminescent navigation bar featuring fluid particle effects and atmospheric distortion.

## Features

- **Bioluminescence**: Glowing elements that pulse and react to interaction.
- **Bubble Particle System**: Canvas-based bubble simulation with varied ascend speeds and wobbles.
- **Sonar Ping Interaction**: Click effects ripple outwards like sonar waves.
- **Chromatic Aberration**: Text and UI elements feature subtle RGB split effects for an underwater lens feel.
- **Atmosphere**: Vignette, blur overlays, and deep blue gradients.

## Dependencies

- **Tailwind CSS** (CDN)
- **Google Fonts**: Cinzel (Titles), Rajdhani (UI).
- **Vanilla JS**: Canvas API for particles.

## Usage

Include `code.html` in an iframe. The bubble system initializes automatically. Navigation state is managed via `animateNavigation(index)`.
