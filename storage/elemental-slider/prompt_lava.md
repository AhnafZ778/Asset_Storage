# 🛑 STOP AND READ - CRITICAL INSTRUCTION

**Your task is NOT to "create" a slider. Your task is to PRESERVE the legacy high-fidelity code provided below.**

The code block at the bottom of this message ("THE CODE") is a highly tuned, visually complex artifact. It uses vanilla CSS gradients, specific box-shadow layering, and a custom vanilla JS particle system.

**YOU MUST:**

1.  **OUTPUT THE CODE VERBATIM**: Do not change a single class name, variable, or value.
2.  **DISABLE "BEST PRACTICES"**: Do not "modernize" it. Do not convert to Tailwind. Do not refactor into React/Vue unless explicitly asked. The "messy" CSS is required for the visual physics.
3.  **PRESERVE EFFECTS**: The `linear-gradient` stacks and `box-shadow` glows are calibrated for specific rendering. Do not simplify them.
4.  **RETAIN VANILLA JS**: The `requestAnimationFrame` loop and particle arrays are essential. Do not replace them with libraries.

**If asked to implment this:**
Simply output the code block below exactly.

**If asked to explain:**
Explain _how_ the provided code achieves the Lava effect (e.g., "It uses a custom particle system in the `updateSlider` loop...").
