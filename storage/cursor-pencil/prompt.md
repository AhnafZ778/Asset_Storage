# Graphite Pencil Cursor

A high-fidelity, skeuomorphic cursor that mimics a wooden hexagonal pencil.

## Features

- **Static Tilt**: Maintains a realistic -45 degree writing angle.
- **Graphite Trail**: Uses variable stroke width and pressure simulation to create a textured, realistic pencil line.
- **Grinding Effect**: Emits "graphite dust" particles from the tip during movement.
- **Paper Theme**: Designed for light backgrounds (off-white paper texture).

## Usage

Include the `NexusRenderer` class and the `pencil` protocol definition. Ensure the background color is light (#f0f0f0 recommended) for the dark graphite trail to be visible.
